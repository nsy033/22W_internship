# Visualization for Data Quality Monitoring

✔️ The researchers collect the mobile data such as wifi, messages, wearable data, etc., from participants into their database. Here, the mobile data collection thing is a significantly important work of the HCI area to analyze it and predict human behaviors based on the analysis. 

✔️ In order to make the data well-collected, usually there exists a manager who takes care of all collecting issues. However, the repetitive and time-consuming tedious work would be burdensome and inefficient.

✔️ As a result, there is an absolute need for a supporter for the manager, having a data visualization dashboard that can explore collected data at a glance.
